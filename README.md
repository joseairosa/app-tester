# Application Tester (app-tester)

* http://github.com/joseairosa/app-tester

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joseairosa/app-tester.png)](http://travis-ci.org/joseairosa/app-tester)

## DESCRIPTION:

This Gem will provide a framework to build command line functional tests against a web application (API, Website, etc)

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Easily create functional tests with just a few lines of code
* Since tests are built as command line tools they can be easily integrated with automatic tools
* Specify command line options in both short (-s, -f, etc...) and long (--server, --file, etc...) definition
* Add colors to make your tests more readable and easier to understand
* Use pre-built tools to analyse your output or build your own

## SYNOPSIS:

```ruby
require "app-tester"

# Initialize framework with test environments
apptester = AppTester.new do |options|
  options.add_environment :github => "https://github.com"
  options.add_environment :google => "https://google.com"
  options.default_environment = :google # A default environment can be specified
end

# Define your tests
apptester.define_test "my test" do |cmd_options, connection|
  result = connection.get do |request|
    request.url "/"
  end

  # Check if we have a 200 OK or not
  AppTester::Checker.status result

  # Convert a file to an array
  p AppTester::Utils.file_to_array cmd_options[:file] unless cmd_options[:file].nil?
end

apptester.set_options_for "my test" do |options_parser|
  options_parser.set_option(:file, "-f", "--file FILE", "File to load")
  options_parser.mandatory_options = 1
end

apptester.run_test "my test"
```

Assuming that this is in a file called my_test.rb, you can run it, via command line:

```
$ ruby my_test.rb --help
```

Will output:

```
my test

    -s, --server OPT                 Server to connect. Default: google
    -f, --file FILE                  File to load
    -h, --help                       Show this message
```

Or you can run the test itself:

```
$ ruby my_test.rb -s github
```

Will output:

```
Connecting to https://github.com...
[SUCCESS] got status 200
```

## REQUIREMENTS:

* json >= 1.7.5
* faraday >= 0.8.4
* optparse

## INSTALL:

It's very easy to install.

```
gem install app-tester
```

Done! :)

## Adding colours to your tests

AppTester has a useful helper class that enables anyone to add colours to the tests.
Lets take the example where we want to output "Hello World" in 2 different colours.

```ruby
require "app-tester"

# Initialize framework with test environments
apptester = AppTester.new do |options|
  options.add_environment :github => "https://github.com"
  options.default_environment = :github # A default environment can be specified
end

# Define your tests
apptester.define_test "my test" do |cmd_options, connection|
  result = connection.get do |request|
    request.url "/"
  end

  puts "#{AppTester::Utils::Colours.red("Hello")} #{AppTester::Utils::Colours.green("World")}"
end

apptester.run_test "my test"
```

Available colours are:

* black
* blue
* green
* cyan
* red
* purple
* brown
* light_gray
* dark_gray
* light_blue
* light_green
* light_cyan
* light_red
* light_purple
* yellow
* white

## Benchmarking

You can benchmark your test. This is very useful to understand if anything is underperforming.
Tests can be nested inside each other.

```
require "app-tester"

# Initialize framework with test environments
apptester = AppTester.new do |options|
  options.add_environment :github => "https://github.com"
  options.default_environment = :github # A default environment can be specified
end

# Define your tests
apptester.define_test "my test" do |cmd_options, connection|
  result = connection.get do |request|
    request.url "/"
  end

  AppTester::Timer.new("test timer 1") do
    sleep 1
  end

  AppTester::Timer.new("test timer 2") do
    sleep 1
    AppTester::Timer.new("test timer 2.1") do
      sleep 1
    end
  end
end

apptester.run_test "my test"
```

This will output:

```
$ ruby examples/benchmark.rb
Connecting to https://github.com...
   Time elapsed to test timer 1, 1001.086 milliseconds
   Time elapsed to test timer 2.1, 1000.12 milliseconds
   Time elapsed to test timer 2, 2001.204 milliseconds
```

## Reading from a file

File are extremely usefull tools.
We can have, for example, a functional test to an API where we want to run 100 strings against an end-point. For this you only need to create a new plain text file, write 1 string per line and use this gem to read them.

Here is an example:

```
require "app-tester"

apptester = AppTester.new do |options|
  options.add_environment :github => "https://github.com"
  options.add_environment :google => "https://google.com"
  options.default_environment = :google
end

apptester.define_test "my test" do |cmd_options, connection|
  result = connection.get do |request|
    request.url "/"
  end
  AppTester::Checker.status result

  my_file = AppTester::Utils.file_to_array cmd_options[:file]

  my_file.each do |line|
    # do awesome stuff with line
  end
end

apptester.set_options_for "my test" do |options_parser|
  options_parser.set_option(:file, "-f", "--file FILE", "File to load")
  options_parser.mandatory_options = 1
end

apptester.run_test "my test"
```
 
## Supported Ruby versions

This library aims to support and is tested against the following Ruby
implementations:

* MRI 1.8.7
* MRI 1.9.2
* MRI 1.9.3
* [JRuby][]

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered
a bug.
