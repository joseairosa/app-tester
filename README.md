# Application Tester (app-tester)

* http://github.com/joseairosa/app-tester

## DESCRIPTION:

This Gem will provide a framework to build command line functional tests against a web application (API, Website, etc)

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Easily create functional tests with just a few lines of code
* Since tests are built as command line tools they can be easily integrated with automatic tools
* Specify command line options in both short (-s, -f, etc...) and long (--server, --file, etc...) definition
* Add colors to make your tests more readable and easier to understand
* Use pre-built tools to analyse your output or build your own

## SYNOPSIS:

```ruby
require "app-tester"

# Initialize framework with test environments
apptester = AppTester.new do |options|
  options.add_environment :github => "https://github.com"
  options.add_environment :google => "https://google.com"
  options.default_environment = :google # A default environment can be specified
end

# Define your tests
apptester.define_test "my test" do |options, connection|
  result = connection.get do |request|
    request.url "/"
  end
  # Check if we have a 200 OK or not
  AppTester::Checker.status result

  # Convert a file to an array
  p AppTester::Utils.file_to_array options[:file] unless options[:file].nil?
end

apptester.set_options_for "my test" do |test_options|
  test_options.set_option(:file, "-f", "--file FILE", "File to load")
  test_options.mandatory_options = 1
end

apptester.run_test "my test"
```

Assuming that this is in a file called my_test.rb, you can run it, via command line:

```
$ ruby my_test.rb --help
```

Will output:

```
my test

    -s, --server OPT                 Server to connect. Default: google
    -f, --file FILE                  File to load
    -h, --help                       Show this message
```

Or you can run the test itself:

```
$ ruby my_test.rb -s github
```

Will output:

```
Connecting to https://github.com...
[SUCCESS] got status 200
```

## REQUIREMENTS:

* json >= 1.7.5
* faraday >= 0.8.4
* optparse

## INSTALL:

It's very easy to install.

```
gem install app-tester
```

Done! :)
